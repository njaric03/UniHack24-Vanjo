## KnowledgeCycle is an app designed to connect people who want to learn and teach various subjects. Unlike traditional tutoring platforms that rely on financial transactions, KnowledgeCycle fosters a community where knowledge is exchanged through teaching. Users input their teaching and learning preferences, and our algorithm creates cycles.
## Participants will rate each other to ensure quality, and cycles can repeat for sustained learning. KnowledgeCycle prioritizes skill-sharing over currency, making learning accessible and collaborative.

Flutter application is on branch Flutter-Firebase.
